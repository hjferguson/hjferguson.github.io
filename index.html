            <p>Hello, I'm Harlan, a student at George Brown College in Toronto, Canada. 
                <br>
                I'm currently studying Computer Programming and Analysis, and I'm looking forward to where this AI boom is headed!
                <br>
                Below are some of my most recent projects.

                <p>For this project, I wanted to make my own dataset and then train a language model. I went with Reddit because of their free API use. After 
                    generating a dataframe with thousands of subreddit titles and their corresponding subreddits as their labels, I cleaned and vectorized 
                    it in preparation for training. Using Scikit's Bayes model, I trained and tuned the data to an average F1 score of 80%. From there, 
                    I developed a webapp for users to enter a title, and have ML predict where that title would belong on Reddit.

                <p>For this project, we were tasked to make a management system. I chose to manage repair workorders
                    because at the time of writing this, I'm working part-time as a maintenance worker at a building. 
                    It allows for basic workorder creation, search, editting, and deletion all with a simple UI. <br><br>Techstack: Python (Tkinter/Sqlite3)

                <p>For this project, my team and I developed a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Java. For the GUI, we used Swing to get a better understanding of that package. 
                    The menu allows for the user to choose between a human player, a computer player using random inputs, or a computer player using the minimax algorithm.
                    It was our introduction to "AI" and recursive algorithms since we had to write the algorithm ourselves and not use imports.

                <p>For this project, I was tasked to create a console application for a store that can manage employee purchases. 
                    Part of the project requirements were to give different discounts to certain employement types, and to track total purchases versus total discounts.
                    I went above and beyond by using best object oriented programming practices, which was not a requirement, and not taught in the course
                    for another few weeks. Going this design route allowed for easier code readability and understanding, compared to how others implemented
                    the assignment, by writing all of it in a single python file.

                <p>This was my first project using APIs, and before I knew what a .csv was... It's definately in need of a V2, but I'm proud nontheless. 
                    The program has a list of friends with their phone numbers and birthdays. I have the program running daily on a raspberry pi,
                    and cron jobs. The program checks the system date, and compares it to dates in the list. If there is a match,
                    the program sends a text message to the recipient using SMTP. I went with this approach because I didn't want to pay for a service like Twilio.
