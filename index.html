                <p>This Emotion Detection Project showcases the development and refinements of a model
                    aimed at identifying human emotions. Initial overfitting was tackled by introducing
                    validation sets and early stopping, without much success. Progressively, through
                    adjustments such as data augmentation, model simplification, and convolutional layer
                    enhancements, slight improvements were achieved. Transitioning from TensorFlow to PyTorch,
                    the project saw significant enhancement with the adoption of EfficientNet, ultimately
                    achieving 68.5% accuracy, which is impressive considering the "high score" for this dataset sits around 75%.
                    This journey not only refined my understanding of neural network optimization but also enhanced my
                    skills in leveraging GPU over CPU, optimizing performance significantly.

                </video>
                <p>For a dive into Angular and real-world API consumption, I built a SpaceX Mission Tracker.
                     This app hits the SpaceX API to list missions, filter them by year, and dive into mission
                      specifics, including embedded launch videos for a richer experience. Despite being a
                       first-timer with Angular, I managed to get a grasp on its ecosystem, from routing to services,
                        and how to properly architect an Angular application.
                    <br><br>
                    Facing challenges like hosting issues and making sure Angular Material played nice with custom
                     styles, I leaned into problem-solving and debugging - crucial skills in any developer's toolkit.
                      The outcome: a functional, informative app that reinforces my fundamentals in Angular and my commitment
                       to learning by doing.

                <p>In my role as the project lead for "City Scav", I guided a talented
                    team in designing and implementing an interactive and user-friendly mobile application. Developed using
                    Android Studio, Java, and Gradle, this app integrates the Google Maps API, allowing
                    users to engage in a digital scavenger hunt. The app features custom markers for
                    points of interest (POIs) which users collect and track on a dedicated screen.
                    We incorporated an achievement system to reward users based on the number of collected
                    POIs and included social sharing capabilities for enhanced user interaction. The app's
                    design reflects an outdoorsy aesthetic with AI-generated colors and images, aimed at
                    providing an enjoyable user experience.

                <p>Achieving a top grade of 100% in my fullstack class's final assignment, I developed an Employee
                    Management Web App using the MERN stack.
                    This web application provides a secure login system with robust password encryption,
                    leading to a dashboard that displays key employee metrics. The dashboard features a
                    pie chart showing the gender distribution, average salary, and total employee count,
                    offering managers immediate and valuable insights.
                    <br><br>
                    A critical feature of this app is the ability to perform CRUD operations on employee
                    data, enabling effective team management. The app's frontend, designed with React.js
                    , offers a user-friendly experience, while the backend, using Node.js and Express.js
                    with MongoDB, ensures reliable data management and server-side operations. This 
                    project demonstrates my capability to blend technical proficiency with practical
                    business solutions in a full-stack development environment.

                <p>Developed in a 48-hour hackathon, this Chrome extension leverages AI to enhance email security without
                    any user setup. Once installed, it seamlessly integrates with your Gmail. The extension scrutinizes 
                    email senders against a pre-defined whitelist. Emails from trusted domains receive a green dot, 
                    indicating safety. For others, it employs a Random Forest classifier, trained on phishing email 
                    datasets, to assess potential risks. Detected phishing attempts are marked with a red 'phishing' 
                    alert, and hyperlinks are disabled to prevent access to potentially harmful sites. Safe emails are 
                    similarly marked with a green dot, reassuring the user of their legitimacy. This solution blends 
                    simplicity with robust security, offering a user-friendly approach to email protection.

                <p>For this project, I wanted to make my own dataset and then train a language model. I went with Reddit because of their free API use. After 
                    generating a dataframe with thousands of subreddit titles and their corresponding subreddits as their labels, I cleaned and vectorized 
                    it in preparation for training. Using Scikit's Bayes model, I trained and tuned the data to an average F1 score of 80%. From there, 
                    I developed a webapp for users to enter a title, and have ML predict where that title would belong on Reddit.

                    I went above and beyond by using best object oriented programming practices, which was not a requirement, and not taught in the course
                    for another few weeks. Going this design route allowed for easier code readability and understanding, compared to how others implemented
                    the assignment, by writing all of it in a single python file.

                <p>This was my first ever project (2020). It originally used SMTP to send birthday messages to my friends. It's what gave me the confidence to go to school
                    full-time for programming and I'm glad I did. 
                    It was fun to learn/write at the time, but it had it's flaws. Like how most mobile carriers don't support SMTP by default. So it ended up not being as helpful
                    as planned. So I figured I would re-write it from scratch using my current expertise. Now the program uses the Twilio API, which allows me to text anyone in my
                    dataset without issue. Now the program is a lot more reliable. Successfully running with cron jobs on a Raspberry Pi3!
