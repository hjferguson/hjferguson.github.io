            <p>Hello, I'm Harlan, a student at George Brown College in Toronto, Canada. 
                <br>
                I'm currently studying Computer Programming and Analysis, and I'm looking forward to where this AI boom is headed.
                <br>
                Below are some of my most recent projects.

                <img src="docs/assets/img/WO_management.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the Workorder Management System." class="project-image">
                <p>For this project, we were tasked to make a management system. I chose to manage repair workorders
                    because at the time of writing this, I'm working part-time as a maintenance worker at a building. 
                    It allows for basic workorder creation, editting, and deletion all with a simple UI. Techstack: Python (Tkinter/Sqlite3)

                <img src="docs/assets/img/ttt.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Tic Tac Toe GUI" class="project-image">
                <p>For this project, my team and I developed a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Java. For the GUI, we used Swing because we hadn't used it before. 
                    The menu allows for the user to choose between a human player, a computer player using random inputs, or a computer player using the minimax algorithm.
                    It was our introduction to "AI" and recursive algorithms.
                    Techstack: Java (Swing/Java)

                <h3>Employee Purchases Manager</h3>
                <img src="docs/assets/img/employee_purchases.jpg" alt="Screenshot of employee purchases console application" class="project-image">
                <p>For this project, I was tasked to create a console application for a store that can manage employee purchases. 
                    We were asked to give different discounts to certain employement types, and to track total purchases versus total discounts.
                    I went above and beyond by using best object oriented programming practices, which was not a requirement, and not taught in the course
                    for another few weeks. Going this design route allowed for tracking to be a lot easier, however it did make
                    data validation in the menu system a bit more difficult.
